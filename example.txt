Well, I saw the thing coming' out of the sky
It had the one long horn, one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said "ooh-eee"
It looks like a purple eater to me
It was a one-eyed, one-horned flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flying' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (one eye?)
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me
I heard him say in a voice so gruff
"I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough"
It was a one-eyed, one-horned flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed, one-horned, flying' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (one horn?)
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line?
He said "eating' purple people and it sure is fine
But that's not the reason that I came to land
I want to get a job in a rock and roll band"
Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flying' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, under-growed, flying' purple people eater
(We wear short shorts) friendly little people eater
What a sight to see (oh!)
And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground
And he started to rock, really rocking' around
It was a crazy ditty with a swinging' tune
(Sing a boop-boop, a-boopa lopa lum bam boom)
Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flying' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, under-growed, flying' purple people eater
"I like short shorts!" friendly little people eater
What a sight to see (purple people?)
Well, he went on his way, and then what do ya know? 
I saw him last night on a TV show
He was blowing it out, really knockin' em dead
Playin' rock and roll music through the horn in his head
