## Scraping TED Talks
### file name: gender_sentiment.py

Description:
A project for a Python class which takes a user input and then scrapes the TED talk website for said word/phrase. The program then analyzes the speaker's name to derive their gender and analyzes the talk's title to deduce the sentiment(positive/negative) of the talk. The program can be used to infer which gender is more positive/negative about any given topic.
